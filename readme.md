## Homework assignment #1

If you don't know, what this is supposed to be:  
 -> It's the homework assignment #1 for the Node.js master class (pirple.thinkific.com)

--------------------------

I used TypeScript for this, because imo it's better and can save a bit of work and confuseness.   
Also, I spreaded the code into multiple files and had a different project structure.
